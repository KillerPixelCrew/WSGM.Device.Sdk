# WSGM.Device.Sdk

The contract a **WSGM Device Plugin** links against. WSGM reconstructs SteamOS Game Mode on Windows
11 handhelds; a device plugin is what teaches it a specific machine — its power limits, fans,
lighting, controller, motion sensors and OEM buttons.

```
dotnet add package WSGM.Device.Sdk
```

`net10.0-windows`, and a deliberate zero-dependency leaf: this assembly is the type-identity
boundary between the host and your plugin, so anything it referenced, your plugin would inherit.

## What a plugin is

One class implementing `IDevicePlugin`, packaged with a `plugin.wsgm.json` manifest. WSGM loads
exactly one installed package into a collectible `AssemblyLoadContext` and drives it through a
single lifecycle:

```csharp
using WSGM.Device.Sdk.Plugin;

public sealed class MyHandheldPlugin : IDevicePlugin
{
    public string PackageId => "com.example.myhandheld";

    // Identify the exact machine without acquiring anything mutable.
    public ValueTask<PluginDetectionResult> DetectAsync(
        PluginDetectionContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken) => ...;

    // One device cycle begins. Acquire transports here; unwind them if cancelled.
    public ValueTask<PluginStartResult> StartAsync(
        PluginStartContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken) => ...;

    // Apply one semantic command, after revalidating identity and current state yourself.
    public ValueTask<CapabilityCommandResult> ExecuteCommandAsync(
        CapabilityCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken) => ...;
}
```

You publish **capabilities** — a TDP limit, a fan curve, a lighting zone — and WSGM renders them,
routes user intent back as `CapabilityCommand`, and shows whatever you report. It never talks to
your hardware.

A sustained-power descriptor can declare `PowerPresets`: named shortcuts combining its watt limit,
the device's slow watt limit, and a `DevicePowerMode`. WSGM owns application and Windows access;
the plugin supplies the device-specific numbers. Validate the complete descriptor set with
`DevicePowerPreset.TryValidate`. Presets do not enforce values after selection.

## What is in here

| Namespace | What it carries |
| --- | --- |
| `Plugin` | `IDevicePlugin`, the host adapter, and `PluginTrace` logging |
| `Lifecycle` | cycle start/stop, controller handoff, diagnostics snapshots |
| `Capabilities` | capability descriptors, commands, states and refusal reasons |
| `Input` | canonical controller state, haptic output, OEM controls, device identity |
| `Identity` | the device identity snapshot a plugin matches against |
| `Glyphs` | glyph packages: profiles, layout, import and asset validation |
| `Settings` | plugin-declared settings sections that WSGM renders and validates |
| `Packaging` | `plugin.wsgm.json` reading, validation and limits |
| `Serialization` | the source-generated JSON context for all of the above |
| `Testing` | `PluginTestKit` — drive your plugin's lifecycle without WSGM |

## The rules this contract enforces

These are not style preferences. They are why the surface looks the way it does:

- **Your plugin runs with WSGM's authority.** It is an assembly the host loads in-process. The SDK
  therefore does not pretend to sandbox you — asset handling checks integrity (hash, bounds,
  well-formedness) and passes your bytes through unchanged. Do not mistake validation for isolation.
- **Report the truth, including uncertainty.** A capability command returns what actually happened.
  A write whose result you could not confirm is reported as uncertain, never retried silently, and
  never reported as success. WSGM shows the user what you tell it.
- **Revalidate on every command.** Identity, firmware, range and current state — every time. The
  helpers are shaped to make that the easy path: a capability that cannot revalidate is awkward to
  express, on purpose.
- **Declare dependencies; never install or repair them.** No SDK path copies a driver, edits a
  registry key, restarts a device or runs an installer. A missing prerequisite makes one feature
  unavailable and says so.
- **Controllers, Steam and HidHide are not yours.** Canonical input goes out, canonical output comes
  back. Plugins never call the virtual-controller backend, never own WSGM's Steam Input lease and
  never touch HidHide.

[`docs/reference.md`](docs/reference.md) describes every one of those types, the rules the host
applies to what a plugin publishes, and every limit, in the order a plugin experiences them.

## Authoring, packaging and testing

[**Device Lab**](https://github.com/KillerPixelCrew/WSGM.DeviceLab) is the companion tool: it
inventories the machine you are targeting, scaffolds a plugin from a captured device, validates and
packs the package, and runs attended hardware tests. `PluginTestKit` in this repository covers the
unattended half — lifecycle, capability and manifest behaviour with no hardware attached.

## Versioning

**Pre-1.0.** Published so plugin authors can pin an exact version, not because the contract is
frozen. Breaking changes move the minor version and are called out in the release notes. Every
public member is documented and the build fails on one that is not, so IntelliSense is the
reference.

## Licence

MIT. See `LICENSE`.

WSGM itself is GPL-3.0-or-later. This contract is deliberately permissive so a plugin may carry
whatever licence its author chooses, including a closed-source vendor or OEM plugin.

/// The canonical state represents the richest supported handheld without assuming a virtual target.
/// A target consumes only what it genuinely supports: the Steam Deck composite takes rear paddles and
/// native motion, Xbox 360 takes neither, and nothing is synthesized to fill the gap. Gyro is passed
/// through where the target supports motion and simply absent where it does not — it is never
/// converted into stick or mouse movement, which is the line between calibration and remapping.
